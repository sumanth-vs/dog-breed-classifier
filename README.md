# Dog Breed Classifier Udacity Project

Using a deep CNN to classfiy dog breeds. Also inludes code for detecting humans or dogs.

Project Outline:

1. Download the data (Human and Dog images)
2. Detect if humans or dogs are in an image
3. Build a CNN from scratch to classify Dog Breeds
4. Train and test the model
5. Using a pretrained model to classify Dog Breeds, testing the model
6. Using all parts of the project to take a input a random image, predict if there is a human or a dog in the image. If there is a dog,      predicting its breed. If there isnt a dog, but a human, calculating the closest resemblance of the face to a particular breed of dog.
